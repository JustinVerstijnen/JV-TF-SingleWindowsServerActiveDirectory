# JV Azure Domain Controller Terraform Deployment

This project deploys a Windows Server VM in Azure and promotes it to a new Active Directory Domain Controller.

The PowerShell bootstrap script is downloaded by the Azure Custom Script Extension from a public GitHub raw URL.

## What it creates

Based on the `project` variable, Terraform creates resources with this naming convention:

```text
Resource group: rg-jv-<project>
VM:             vm-jv-<project>
OS disk:        osdisk-jv-<project>
VNET:           vnet-jv-<project>
NIC:            nic-jv-<project>
Public IP:      pip-jv-<project>
NSG:            nsg-jv-<project>
```

Default AD forest name:

```text
internal.justinverstijnen.nl
```

Default internal IP:

```text
10.69.0.4
```

## GitHub script hosting

1. Create a public GitHub repository.
2. Upload this file to the repository:

```text
scripts/bootstrap-dc.ps1
```

3. Open the file in GitHub.
4. Click **Raw**.
5. Copy the raw URL.
6. Paste it in `terraform.tfvars`:

```hcl
bootstrap_script_url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JustinVerstijnen/JV-TF-SingleWindowsServerActiveDirectory/refs/heads/main/scripts/bootstrap-dc.ps1"
```

Keep this value aligned with the actual file name:

```hcl
bootstrap_script_file_name = "bootstrap-dc.ps1"
```

When you change the script after a deployment and want the Custom Script Extension to run again, increase this value:

```hcl
bootstrap_script_version = "2"
```

For first-time deployment this does not matter; the extension runs during VM creation.

## RDP source IP allow list

RDP is not opened to the entire internet by default. Configure the allowed source IP addresses in `terraform.tfvars`:

```hcl
rdp_source_address_prefixes     = ["12.34.56.78/32", "78.56.34.12/32"]
```

For a single public IP address:

```hcl
rdp_source_address_prefixes = ["12.34.56.78/32"]
```

## Requirements

Install these tools on your workstation:

- Visual Studio Code
- Terraform CLI
- Azure CLI
- HashiCorp Terraform extension for Visual Studio Code

## How to run from Visual Studio Code

1. Extract this ZIP file.
2. Open the extracted folder in Visual Studio Code.
3. Copy `terraform.tfvars.example` to `terraform.tfvars`.
4. Edit `terraform.tfvars` and fill in:
   - `subscription_id`
   - `admin_password`
   - `safe_mode_password`
   - `bootstrap_script_url`
   - `rdp_source_address_prefixes`
5. Open a terminal in Visual Studio Code.
6. Sign in to Azure:

```powershell
az login
```

7. Optional: set the correct subscription:

```powershell
az account set --subscription "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
```

8. Initialize Terraform:

```powershell
terraform init
```

9. Format and validate:

```powershell
terraform fmt -recursive
terraform validate
```

10. Create a deployment plan:

```powershell
terraform plan -out main.tfplan
```

11. Apply the deployment:

```powershell
terraform apply main.tfplan
```

## VS Code tasks

This ZIP contains `.vscode/tasks.json` with tasks for:

- Terraform Init
- Terraform Format
- Terraform Validate
- Terraform Plan
- Terraform Apply
- Terraform Destroy

In VS Code, open the Command Palette and run:

```text
Tasks: Run Task
```

Then select the Terraform task you want to run.

## Logs on the deployed server

After deployment, check this folder on the VM:

```text
C:\JV-TF-Install\
```

## Destroy the lab environment

When you are done testing:

```powershell
terraform destroy
```

## Security note

The values `admin_password` and `safe_mode_password` are marked as sensitive in Terraform, but they can still end up in Terraform state files and plan files. Do not commit `terraform.tfvars`, `.tfstate`, or `.tfplan` files to Git.

For production usage, use a secure approach such as Azure Key Vault, secure pipeline variables, and a protected remote Terraform backend.
